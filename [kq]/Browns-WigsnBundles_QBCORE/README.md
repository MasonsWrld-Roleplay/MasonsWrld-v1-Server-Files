# Browns Wigs N Bundles by Brown Development [QBCore]

# How it works 

1. Players can go to the Wigs N Bundles Shop to buy items needed to craft wigs (Hair Bundles, Wig Cap, Sew In Kit, Wig Table)

2. Players can then place down the Wig Table and third eye target it to either craft wigs or pickup the table

3. Once wigs are crafted players can go anywhere in the map and start corner selling wigs by doing a chat command ("/wigdealer" by default)

4. once the chat command is executed NPC's will spawn away from the Player then jog up to the player to buy wigs

5. The player can either press 'E' to sell some wigs to the NPC or 'G' too deny the sale or transaction

6. When selling wigs players have a rare chance of the NPC handing them a "Clientale Phone"

7. Players can then use the "Clientale Phone" item to call a client who will order their wigs in bulk 

8. once the call succeeds the Client will send them a location to their house where the player will walk into the house and deliver the wigs 
and make 2x amount the money they would make when corner selling the wigs
